# ReactFlow
A chatbot created using Google's DialogFlow, React.js and Node.js!

This project currently uses Materialize CSS for styling components (which I am not a very huge fan of, to be honest). I will soon remove all Materialize and replace everything with Tailwind CSS instead.

## Find a hosted version of this app [HERE](https://reactflow-bot.herokuapp.com/).

## Steps to run on your machine:
- Honestly, its too much to type out, just follow the course listed below for setup.

## TODO:
- [ ] Change the really ugly UI.
- [ ] Make the app responsive.
- [ ] Add more natural intents to the DialogFlow.
- [ ] Possibly add voice chat features.
- [ ] Integrate more DialogFlow options.
- [ ] Optimize the backend by removing redundant code.

### This chatbot was made while following this Course: [Create Chatbot for Website with React and Node.js](https://www.udemy.com/course/chatbot-for-website-with-react-and-nodejs/).
